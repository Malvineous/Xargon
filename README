Xargon - Copyright 1992-1994 Allen Pilgrim
This port of Xargon is by Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>

You will need SDL available to build this port.

Build instructions:

 ./autogen.sh        # Only needed if building git version
 ./configure && make

This will produce ./src/xrfile01 which should be placed in the same directory
as the Xargon data files (just like the DOS .EXE file.)  If you don't have the
data files handy, all three episodes have been released as freeware and can be
downloaded from http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Xargon.html

If you encounter any problems with this port or need help, please ask on the
RGB Classic Games forum at http://www.classicdosgames.com/forum/  You can also
get help here if you are stuck somewhere in the game!

Known issues:

 - Levels scroll right to left when first loading.

 - No sound or music yet.

 - Will only run on little-endian CPUs due to endian-specific file handling.
